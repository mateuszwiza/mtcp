# Parking Facility Performance Prediction Using Multi-Target Conformal Regression
**Mateusz Wiza**

## Included files:

1. baseline.py - Script for applying single-target conformal regression 
with a single-targetregression model; All dependencies are given in 
requirements.txt; Original data set not provided due to confidentiality.

Contents:
 - Data Preparation
 - Experiment to determine the best performing underlying model
 - Experiment to determine the best performing normalizing model
 - Target-wise prediction interval width and validity visualization for optimal solution
   (can be reproduced using CSV files in 'graph-data' folder)

2. multi-target-conformal-regression.py - Script for applying single-target 
conformal regression with a multi-target regression model; Additional 
dependency: nonconformist package modified to support multi-target underlying
models (not included); All other dependencies are given in  requirements.txt; 
Original data set not provided due to confidentiality. 

Contents:
 - Data Preparation
 - Experiment to determine the best performing underlying multi-target model
 - Target-wise prediction interval width and validity visualization for optimal solution
   (can be reproduced using CSV files in 'graph-data' folder)

3. copula-based-conformal-regression.py - Script for plotting the results of
copula-based conformal prediction. Results were generated by running a pre-existing 
algorithm (not included): https://github.com/M-Soundouss/CopulaConformalMTR/blob/master/code/conformal_multi_target_regression.py
modified by replacing the underlying and normalizing models; Results are stored in
JSON files (in 'graph-data/copulas' folder); All dependencies are given in 
requirements.txt;

Contents:
 - Hyper-rectangle volume and validity visualization for optimal solution
 - Target-wise prediction interval width visualization for optimal solution
